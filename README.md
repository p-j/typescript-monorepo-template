# Typescript Monorepo Template

This template is intended for OSS Typescript based projects and is centered around a few tools:

- **yarn** for dependency management and running tasks like `test` or `publish`
- **lerna** for running package level commands
- **changeset** for managing changelog generation, and release creation
